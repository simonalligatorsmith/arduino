Projects in Arduino by me!

dogFeeder.ino
* Program for Arduino board that moved a servo arm to release food pellets into a bowl. Button is held down for X flashes of LED representing number of hours to delay. LED flashes X number of times to confirm, then waits X hours before moving servo arm.
* I still need to upload board layout for this, that's a-coming.
